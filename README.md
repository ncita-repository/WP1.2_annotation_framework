# WP1.2_annotation_framework

### NCITA repository Work Package 1.2: XNAT-OHIF viewer - Annotation framework
Specific repositories and projects of the form WP1.x-y are for specific second-level work packages in the NCITA repository strategy.

The aim of WP 1.2 is to develop additions to XNAT and the OHIF viewer to implement flexible case report forms. The strategy starts with implementing the RSNA's RadReports. These have a relatively limited set of items that can be included (free text boxes, radio buttons, etc.) but there is a significant library of examples already "out there". Once this has been integrated, we will move on to more complex annotations (for example, lines, angles, regions-of-interest) and consider user preferences, hanging protocols and annotation workflows in general. 

The NCITA repository site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear!
